CoinCollectionGame is a dynamic programming-based game where two players take turns selecting coins from either end of a list to maximize their score. It demonstrates dynamic programming principles, with a visually appealing user interface built using JavaFX, complete with animations and smooth transitions, making the gameplay engaging and interactive.

Dynamic Programming Explanation:
The game uses dynamic programming to determine the optimal coin collection strategy. The state dp[i, j] represents the maximum number of coins a player can collect from the subarray of coins between indices i and j.

Base Case 1: If thereâ€™s only one coin (i == j), the maximum number of coins is simply coins[i].

Base Case 2: For two adjacent coins (|i - j| = 1), the maximum is the larger of coins[i] or coins[j].

Recursive Case: For more than two coins (i < j), the player has two choices:

Pick the coin at index i, then the second player plays optimally on the subarray [i+1, j].

Pick the coin at index j, then the second player plays optimally on the subarray [i, j-1]. The value of dp[i, j] is the maximum coins the current player can collect between these two choices.

Error Condition: If i > j, the subarray is invalid.
